# Java-Fitness-App

Overview:

The first part is to create an object to embody the concept of “Workouts.”  
The second part of this phase is to write a file reader that will load the workouts from a CSV (comma separated values) file into the Workouts object. 
The main javaFit file has a series of function calls that will be used to test if the APP works.
